Bring the cream to the boil in another pan, then pour it over the chocolate. Leave for 2 mins, then add the vanilla and stir until smooth. Cool, then chill until set.", "Peel the caramel from the cling film, then snip into thumbnail-size pieces; wet kitchen scissors work best. Spread cocoa powder over a large baking tray. Take a heaped tsp of the truffle mix then, with cocoa-dusted hands, poke in a caramel chunk. Squash the mix around the caramel to seal, then roll into a ball. Put onto the tray, then shake to coat in the cocoa. Repeat with the rest of the mix, then freeze, or chill if making less than 3 days ahead."]

Test the internal temperature with a thermometer, if you have one \u2013 it should read 75C when it\u2019s ready. Or insert a metal skewer into the centre of the parcel and check it is piping hot. Cover loosely with foil and leave to rest for at least 15 mins before serving. Top with the reserved sage leaves, then slice. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 2 days."]
